# Reliability-based-Equitable-Transit-Frequency-Design-
1. Data for paper:
Jiang Y. Reliability-based Equitable Transit Frequency Design. Under Review in Transportmetrica A.
> These are hypothetical bus lines created for research purpose only
2. Contact: yujiang@dtu.dk
3. The following files are contained in the folder
- Figure of each individual bus line in the Sioux Fall network 
- Network data 
  - SiouxFalls_flow.tntp
  - SiouxFalls_node.tntp
  > the above two files can be obtained from https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks
- stops.txt: bus stops 
- Demand.txt
    * demand
    * the first column is origin node
    * the second column is destination node
    * the third column is the demand value
- IniFre.txt
    * initial frequency of the transit lines
4. The graphs can be obtained by running the python file
  - main.py
